# Kedro Machine learning Deployment Tool

The primary focus of this project is on the deployment component because its main purpose is to demonstrate a knowledge of the basic concepts involved in deploying a model. In other words, given the project's scope, the ML model itself is less important and of lesser significance because it just serves as a placeholder for a deployment demonstration. Therefore, for this project, we decided to better understand Kedro as a key ML deployment tool and to show a simple example of its implementation.
